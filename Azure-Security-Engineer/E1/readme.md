# Can You Configure Multi-Scope Resource Permissions?

## About

In this challenge, you will configure role-based access control (RBAC) roles that will allow users to create and deploy Azure resources. First, you will assign roles at the resource group scope for two users. Next, you will create a virtual network as one of the users, and then you will create a virtual machine as the other user. Finally, you will assign a role at the resource scope, and then you will verify the security configuration.
